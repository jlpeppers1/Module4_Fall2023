#We put generic doc string here

#Define a function called hourly_employee_input
    #add a function docstring right under it
    #within the function; ask for user input 3 times
    #get a string (name), get an int (hours worked), get a float (pay)
    #print a string including that information
    #maybe print output looks something like 'Joe worked 40 hours at a rate of $5.00'

#driver code
if __name__ == "__main__":
    pass #delete pass and add our function call here

#Joe's opinion: Get above pseudocode converted to code and working as intended
#then go back and add input validation
